[Flexibility] is a polyfill for the [Flexible Box Layout], commonly known as
Flexbox. With Flexibility, you get to design beautiful, flexible layouts on the
web without sacrificing the experience in older browsers.

Flexbox lays out, aligns, and distributes elements in a container, even
when their size is unknown or dynamic. To better understand Flexbox, read
[Chris Coyier]’s excellent [Complete Guide to Flexbox].

To start using Flexbox in Internet Explorer 8 & 9 or any older browser, download the
[flexibility.js] script and include it anywhere on your page.

```html
<script src="flexibility.js"></script>
```

If you’re only targeting Internet Explorer 10 and lower, add a
`-js-display: flex` declaration before any `display: flex` declarations in your
CSS, or use [PostCSS Flexibility] to automate this during your build process.

```css
.container {
	-js-display: flex;
	display: flex;
}
```

If you’re targeting other browsers, use the `data-style` attribute to alert these browsers to your changes.

```html
<div data-style="display: flex;"></div>
```

When you’re ready to polyfill flexbox with JavaScript, use the `flexibility`
method on the outermost element you would like to polyfill.

```js
flexibility(document.documentElement);
```

## API
